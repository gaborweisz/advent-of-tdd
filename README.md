# Advent of TDD

A follow along workshop to introduce the idea and concepts of using TDD for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) problems.

## Introduction

In this workshop you will use the Day 1 problem from Advent of Code 2022.
In the following exercises you will review the day 1 instructions, design and implement your tests first.
We will guide you on some of the design and thought process behind each exercise.
A branch will be given at the end of the exercise with a possible solution.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1, Part 1: Breaking up the Problem - Unit Testing 

Start by reading the instructions for [Part 1](day1-part1.md).
As with regular requirements, there's a lot of extra information surrounding what you need to implement.
To solve the first part of the problem there are a few pieces to consider.
You are not going to go straight to getting the answer required by the exercise, instead we are going to start by focusing on the `Elf`.

Looking at the problem the `Elf` is a key domain object and is a good place to start.
Approaching this problem I would look at the requirements and note that we are likely going to be reading line-by-line a file.
Each blank line represents the creation of a new `Elf`.
This exercise is going to be quite simple, but let's focus on creating the following tests.

* Create an `Elf` and `assertThat` it has `getTotalCalories` of 0. 
This is our post condition of creating an `Elf`.
* Now let's use the example case to `addCalories(1000)` and call `getTotalCalories` to `assertThat` it is equal to 1000.
* Now let's `addCalories(1000)`, `addCalories(2000)`, `addCalories(3000)` and call `getTotalCalories` to `assertThat` it is equal to 6000.
* Given that we're going to need to find the max calories, we're going to need to compare `Elf`s together. 
Let's use the Java standard for Comparing (e.g. `Comparable<Elf>`) to write some tests to compare `Elfs` for their total calories
You only need two tests for this.

Check your solution against the `exercise-1` branch.

### Exercise 2, Part 1: Spike - Reading in Input

Reading input from a file in Java is not always straight forward.
There will often be times that it is difficult to figure out which library you need or how to do something.
In this Exercise we will create a spike, in this spike we're exploring without any pressure to test.
You should experiment how to read the file into a `Collection<Elf>`.

Spikes are a useful way to explore before we write our tests.
Check out your spike vs the spike in the `exercise-2` branch.

### Exercise 3, Part 1: Mock Testing and Putting Everything Together

Taking the content of the spike we created in exercise 2, let's create an `ElfCalorieCounter`.
This is going to take a `BufferedReader` as input, which can be quite tricky to test.
To test this collaboration we will use Mockito to create a mock `BufferedReader` and implement a few simple tests.
This will allow us to control the input and test the behaviour.

Try and create a test and set up your mock for the following scenarios:
* When `BufferedReader` throws an `IOException` expect an `RuntimeException`
* Creates an Elf when the file has two lines with 1000 and 3000 with value of 4000
   * NB you will note that our spike code in the given example solution contains a bug, can you spot and correct this whilst writing your tests? 
   * Add an `int maxElfCalories()` and test that it returns 4000
* Creates a List<Elf> when the file has 5 lines with 1000, 3000, blank line, 5000, 5000
   * `int maxElfCalories()` and test that it returns 10,000

Add a `Solution` class that uses the other part of the spike to read in the file and print the answer to the problem.
Does it work as expected?
You can find the solution and the expected value in the `exercise-3` branch.

### Exercise 4, Part 2: A New Part of the Problem

[Part 2](/day1-part2.md) brings in a change in the requirements. 
The change is quite easy to implement, we now need to find the top 3 total calories for the Elves.
Let's add a new test to `TestElfCalorieCounter` to finish today's puzzle.
You can find the solution in the `exercise-4` branch.

A big part of TDD is following the Red, Green, Refactor processes.
Spend some time working through both the tests and the subject under test and refactor as necessary.
